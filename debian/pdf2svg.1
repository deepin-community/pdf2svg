.SH NAME
pdf2svg \- PDF to SVG convertor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdf2svg
.RI pdffile
.RI svgfile
.RI [ "page number" ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
pdf2svg is a tiny command-line utility using Cairo and Poppler to
convert PDF documents into SVG files.  Multi-page PDF can be split
up to one SVG per page by passing a file naming specification.
.PP
The program does not follow the usual GNU command line syntax.
.PP
The first argument is the source PDF file, the second argument is
the filename of the output SVG file (or a specification, see below
for details).
.SH OPTIONS
The third parameter is optional and serves as a page selector. If
omitted it defaults to the first page of the passed PDF.  If passed it
must be a valid page label (typically it is a value such as "iii"
or "3").
.SS all
This special selector causes the program to iterate over all pages
in the PDF.  Because it cannot save multiple pages into one single SVG
the second parameter is expected to contain a sensible file
specification:
.PP
.B pdf2svg
.RI document.pdf
.RI output\-page%d.svg
.RI \fIall\fP
.PP
The usual format modificators work as well: \fIoutput\-page%02d.svg\fP
will give you output\-page00.svg, output\-page01.svg, etc.
